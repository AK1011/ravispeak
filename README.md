RaviSpeak
=========

A tool to de-Ravify speech, so people can understand you. Inspired by Ravi's terrible grammar in Skype.


How to use:

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to your directory for RaviSpeak
3. Open your users.rv file and put your Skype username in to replace mine (If you don't replace mine, it doesn't mean you can edit my messages. You still aren't logged in as me)
4. Use the command > ruby sbot.rb
5. Give it a bit to catch up to your chats (around a half a minute to a minute)
6. Type in Skype and it will edit your messages for you
